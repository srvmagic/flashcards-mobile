Udacicards Project

Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for test and code review purposes. The project consists of code that has been tested on iOS

Prerequisites

npm or yarn needs to be installed. You would also need an editor like Atom or Visual Studio to view the code. I used expo to debug/test the code. 

Installing

To see if npm is installed, type npm -v in Terminal.To see if yarn is installed, type yarn -v in Terminal. Install expo using this link https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation.html

On expo IDE click share to share the app link to your iphone. Expo will send you a message with that link. Click the link and the app should open up in the 
expo app

You can now view the udacicards app in the browser.
